Extract unique Python-Exceptions with their traceback from a log file.

## WARNING!

The extraction logic here is heuristic and may fail you. Don't depend on it for any life or death situations. Also, please submit feedback on how it could be improved!

## Installational

 Clone this repository and install with

    python setup.py install

This adds a utility called `exception` or `exception.exe` to your path.

## Usage

To extract the Python tracebacks from a log called _logfile.txt_, run:

    $ exception -f logfile.txt

If you want to exclude certain exceptions, try:

    $ exception -f logfile.txt -e ValueError,AttributeError

You can all pass multiple filenames:

    $ exception -f logfile1.txt logfile2.txt

This would exclude would exclude any ``ValueError`` or ``AttributeError`` tracebacks from the output.

The tool can also read the log file from stdout, e.g.:

    cat logfile.txt | exception

or

    cat logfile.txt | exception -e ValueError
